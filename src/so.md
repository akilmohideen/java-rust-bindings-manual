# Shared Object and Dynamic Library Files
Shared object and dynamic library files effectively serve the same purpose in this
scope. They provide executable code to outside sources. This means that once Java is 
given the address to the code for a function in this file, it is ready to run once
called. Although they effectively share the same purpose, their file types differ
based on the system running. Below is a table with each file extension used by three 
of the most common operating systems.

| **System** | **File Extension** |

| Linux | .so |
| Windows | .dll |
