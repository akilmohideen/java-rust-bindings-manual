# What This Manual Hopes to Accomplish

By the end, this manual will:

1. **Provide a Step-by-Step Guide**: Developers will be walked through setting up bindings between Rust and Java, and configuring these bindings for projects.
2. **Demonstrate Practical Examples**: Examples of properly designed bindings will be provided and explained. These examples will be provided for both easy and complex topics including exposing Rust functions, handling complex data types, managing lifetimes and memory, and handling multi-threading.
3. **Simplify Rust-Java Integration**: The manual will demystify the integration process, helping developers avoid common pitfalls related to ownership, memory management, and data layout discrepancies.
4. **Address Advanced Topics**: In addition to the basics, the manual will explore advanced topics such as thread safety, handling Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules in Java, and how to handle complex data structures and edge cases.

By following this guide, developers will gain a deep understanding of how to efficiently and safely call Rust libraries from Java, making full use of both Java 22’s [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) and Rust’s robust performance and memory safety features.
