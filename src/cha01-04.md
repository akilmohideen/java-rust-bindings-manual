# What This Manual Hopes to Accomplish

This manual aims to:
1. **Provide a Step-by-Step Guide**: It will walk developers through setting up their environment, configuring Rust and Java projects, and linking the two using the Foreign Function and Memory API.
2. **Demonstrate Practical Examples**: By the end of the manual, developers will have worked through real-world examples, including exposing Rust functions, handling complex data types, managing lifetimes and memory, and handling multi-threading.
3. **Simplify Rust-Java Integration**: The manual will demystify the integration process, helping developers avoid common pitfalls related to ownership, memory management, and data layout discrepancies.
4. **Address Advanced Topics**: In addition to the basics, the manual will explore advanced topics such as thread safety, handling Rust’s ownership and borrowing rules in Java, and how to handle complex data structures and edge cases.

By following this guide, developers will gain a deep understanding of how to efficiently and safely call Rust libraries from Java, making full use of both Java 22’s Foreign Function and Memory API and Rust’s robust performance and memory safety features.
