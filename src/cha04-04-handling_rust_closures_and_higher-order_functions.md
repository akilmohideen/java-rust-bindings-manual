## Handling Rust Closures and Higher-Order Functions

Rust closures are not directly compatible with Javaâ€™s FFI. You may need to wrap them in Rust before exposing them to Java or convert them to Java lambdas or `MethodHandles`.

Example:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn apply_closure(x: i32, f: extern "C" fn(i32) -> i32) -> i32 {
    f(x)
}
```
