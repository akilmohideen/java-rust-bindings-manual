# Memory Layouts and Structs

## Identifying Structs and Memory Layouts in Rust
When Rust returns complex data types like **structs** or **arrays**, Java needs to correctly interpret their [memory layout](memory_layout.md). Rust’s struct fields are aligned in memory based on their type sizes, so Java must use **StructLayout** and [ValueLayout](value_layout.md) to match the Rust memory layout exactly.

### Example:
```rust
#[repr(C)] // Add this!
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

The `#[repr(C)]` attribute ensures that the memory layout of `Point` follows the `C ABI`, making it compatible with Java’s [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454).

## Handling Structs in Java
Java uses **StructLayout** to define memory layouts that match Rust’s struct layouts. When dealing with Rust structs, it’s essential to ensure that the memory allocated on the Java side is properly aligned and of the correct size to match the layout of the Rust struct.

### What You Need to Do:
- Use **StructLayout** to define the memory layout that mirrors the fields of the Rust struct.
- Allocate a[**MemorySegment** that is large enough and properly aligned to hold the struct’s data.

## Java Example (Handling Structs):
```java
// Define the memory layout of the Rust `Point` struct in Java
StructLayout pointLayout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("x"),  // Field `x` (i32 in Rust)
    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("y")   // Field `y` (i32 in Rust)
);

// Allocate memory for the struct
var arena = Arena.ofConfined();  // Confined Arena for memory management
MemorySegment pointSegment = arena.allocate(pointLayout);

// Set the fields of the Point struct
VarHandle xHandle = pointLayout.varHandle(PathElement.groupElement("x"));
VarHandle yHandle = pointLayout.varHandle(PathElement.groupElement("y"));
xHandle.set(pointSegment, 0, 10);  // Set x to 10
yHandle.set(pointSegment, 0, 20);  // Set y to 20
```

## Explanation:
- [**StructLayout**](struct_layout.md): Defines the layout of the Rust `Point` struct, where each field is aligned according to its type (in this case, both fields are `i32`, so each is 4 bytes).
- [**VarHandle**](variable_handle.md): Used to access and set individual fields (`x` and `y`) in the memory segment allocated for the struct.
- [**MemorySegment**](memory_segment.md): Represents the allocated memory for the struct, and Java can safely manipulate it according to the struct’s layout.
