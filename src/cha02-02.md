# Setting Up Rust
## Step 1: Exporting Rust Functions

To make Rust functions callable from Java, you need to:
1. **Prevent name mangling**: Add `#[no_mangle]` to ensure Java can find the Rust function by its exact name.
1. **Use the C ABI**: Add `extern "C"` so the function adheres to the C Application Binary Interface (ABI), which Java can interact with.

### Before Adding #[no_mangle] and extern "C"
Here’s a simple Rust function that adds two numbers. This version cannot yet be used by Java because the function name will be mangled and will not conform to the C ABI.
```rust,ignore
// Rust function: Adds two numbers
pub fn add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```
### After Adding #[no_mangle] and extern “C"
To make the function callable from Java, modify it as follows:
```rust,ignore
// Rust function: Adds two numbers
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn add_numbers(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```
## Step 2: Modify Cargo.toml
Add the following to the Cargo.toml file to specify that the library should be compiled as a [shared library](so.md):
```toml
[lib] 
crate-type = [“cdylib”]
```
## Step 3: Build Cargo.toml
Run the following command to compile the Rust project into a shared library:
`cargo build --release`  

**Output**: The shared library will be generated in the `target/release/` directory.
* On Windows: `FileName.dll`
* On Linux: `FileName.so`
* On macOS: `FileName.dylib`

## File Organization Example
Here’s how your project should look after building the shared library:
```bash
rust_project/
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs          # Contains the Rust function
├── Cargo.toml          # Rust project configuration
└── target/
    └── release/
        └── libmylib.dylib  # Shared library (for macOS)
```
