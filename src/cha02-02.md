# Setting Up Rust

## Step 1: Exporting Rust Functions
To make Rust functions callable from Java, we need to do two things:
- Use [`#[no_mangle]`](sym_ex_gen.md) to prevent Rust from renaming (mangling) the function name internally. This ensures Java can find the function by its exact name.
- Declare the function with [`extern "C"`](sym_ex_gen.md) to make sure it uses the **C Application Binary Interface (ABI)**, which Java understands.

### Rust Example:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn create_point(x: i32, y: i32) -> *mut Point {
    Box::into_raw(Box::new(Point { x, y }))
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn get_x(point: *mut Point) -> i32 {
    unsafe { (*point).x }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn free_point(point: *mut Point) {
    unsafe { Box::from_raw(point); } // Frees the allocated memory
}

struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

### Explanation:
- `*mut Point:` The function returns a raw pointer (`*mut Point`), which Java can manage using the [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454).

## Step 2: Compiling Rust into a Shared Library
To compile the Rust code into a format Java can load, modify the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

Then, compile the Rust project into a [shared library](so.md):

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This command will generate a shared library file (e.g., `libmyrustlib.so` or `myrustlib.dll`) in the `target/release/` directory, which Java can dynamically load.
