# Handling Ownership and Borrowing
## Identifying Ownership and Borrowing in Rust
Rust enforces strict [ownership](ownership.md) rules. When a function in Rust takes ownership of a value (e.g., `Box`, `Vec`), it means the caller no longer owns that value and cannot use it again unless ownership is returned. [Borrowing](borrowing_and_aliasing.md) (`&T` or `&mut T`) allows temporary access to a value without transferring ownership.
### Example:
```rust
fn take_ownership(v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Takes ownership of v
    v
}

fn borrow(v: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    // Borrows v temporarily
    v[0]
}
```
## Handling Ownership in Java
When Rust functions take ownership of values, Java needs to manage when to free the underlying memory. If Java creates the object (e.g., calling `Box` in Rust), it must free the object explicitly. Java must also ensure the memory is valid during the borrowed referenceâ€™s lifetime.
### What You Need to Do:
- **For functions that take ownership**: You need to call the appropriate Rust cleanup function (`like` drop or `free`) using **[`MethodHandle`](method_handle.md)** in Java.
- **For borrowed references**: Manage memory using **[`Arena`](arenas.md)** to ensure that memory remains valid for the borrowed duration.
### Java Example (Handling Ownership):
```java
// Create a Rust-owned Box and pass ownership MemorySegment rustBox = (MemorySegment) 
RustBindings.createBox.invokeExact(10); 

// Call Rust function to take ownership of the box 
RustBindings.takeOwnership.invokeExact(rustBox); 

// Manually free the Box when done 
RustBindings.freeBox.invokeExact(rustBox); // Ensures no memory leaks
```
### Explanation:
[MemorySegment](memory_segment.md) represents the Rust-allocated memory in Java. After transferring ownership to Rust, Java explicitly calls `freeBox` to release the memory.
