# Handling Ownership and Borrowing
## Identifying Ownership and Borrowing in Rust
Rust enforces strict [ownership](ownership.md) rules. When a function in Rust takes ownership of a value (e.g., `Box`, `Vec`), it means the caller no longer owns that value and cannot use it again unless ownership is returned. [Borrowing](borrowing_and_aliasing.md) (`&T` or `&mut T`) allows temporary access to a value without transferring ownership.

### Pre-Modified Rust Function:
Hereâ€™s an example of two functions that demonstrate ownership and borrowing in Rust **before modification** for interoperability with Java:

```rust
fn take_ownership(v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Takes ownership of v
    v
}

fn borrow(v: &Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    // Borrows v temporarily
    v[0]
}
```
#### Explanation:
`take_ownership`:
* Transfers ownership of the `Vec` to the function.
* The original owner can no longer use `v` unless ownership is explicitly returned.
`borrow`:
* Borrows the `Vec` temporarily to access its first element without transferring ownership.
* The caller retains ownership.

### Modified Rust Function
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn take_ownership(v: *mut Vec<i32>) -> *mut Vec<i32> {
    // Transfers ownership of the vector
    v
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn borrow(v: *mut Vec<i32>) -> i32 {
    unsafe { (*v)[0] } // Borrowing a raw pointer
}
```

## Handling Ownership in Java
When Rust functions take ownership of values or borrow them, Java developers must manage memory explicitly to prevent leaks or invalid references.

### What You Need to Do:
- **For functions that take ownership**: You need to call the appropriate Rust cleanup function (`like` drop or `free`) using **[`MethodHandle`](method_handle.md)** in Java. is released once the object is no longer needed.
- **For borrowed references**: Manage memory using **[`Arena`](arenas.md)** to ensure that memory remains valid for the borrowed duration.

### Java Example (Handling Ownership):
```java
// Create a Rust-owned Box and pass ownership MemorySegment rustBox = (MemorySegment) 
RustBindings.createBox.invokeExact(10); 

// Call Rust function to take ownership of the box 
RustBindings.takeOwnership.invokeExact(rustBox); 

// Manually free the Box when done 
RustBindings.freeBox.invokeExact(rustBox); // Ensures no memory leaks
```
#### Explanation:
[MemorySegment](memory_segment.md) represents the Rust-allocated memory in Java. Java interacts with this using the Foreign Function & Memory API. When `takeOwnership` is called, the Rust function takes ownership of `rustBox`. Java then explicitly calls `freeBox` to release the memory allocated in Rust and prevent leaks.
