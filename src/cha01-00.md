# Introduction

Welcome to ***Java Bindings for Rust: A Comprehensive Guide***, a guide to using Rust from within Java. This process can be notoriously confusing, and the information on how to do it is dense and scattered across various sources. This guide teaches how to make these bindings in a digestible way. Every section was created to be as short and readable as possible without barring important information. Complex details will be kept in their own sections, and will be linked to when they are applicable.
