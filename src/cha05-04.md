# Segmentation Fault or Undefined Behavior

**Cause**: This typically results from misaligned memory or accessing freed memory. Common causes include mismatched layouts, accessing unallocated memory, or not using the correct arena.

**Solution**:
1. **Verify `MemoryLayout` Alignment**: Ensure `MemoryLayout` precisely matches Rust’s struct or array layout, particularly if `#[repr(C)]` is used.
2. **Use Arenas Appropriately**: Manage memory with confined or auto arenas to ensure data remains valid only as long as needed.

## Example 
**In Rust**:
```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct Data {
    x: i32,
    y: i64,
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn create_data() -> *mut Data {
    Box::into_raw(Box::new(Data { x: 1, y: 2 }))
}
```
**In Java**:
```java
StructLayout dataLayout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("x"),
    ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG.withName("y")
);

var arena = Arena.ofConfined();
MemorySegment dataSegment = arena.allocate(dataLayout);
MethodHandle createData = RustBindings.createDataHandle();
dataSegment = (MemorySegment) createData.invokeExact();
```
## Explanation and Solution:
**Alignment Matching**: Ensure `JAVA_INT` and `JAVA_LONG` are aligned with Rust’s `i32` and `i64`. Java’s layout must match precisely, as alignment affects performance and stability.

**Safe Memory Access**: Use confined arenas to allocate and manage Rust data safely, freeing memory once Java no longer requires it.

## Why It’s Tricky:
Alignment and memory lifetime issues can cause silent data corruption or segmentation faults, making layout precision and memory management critical for stability.
