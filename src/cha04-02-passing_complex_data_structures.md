## Passing Complex Data Structures

Complex Rust structs with nested fields or references need to be carefully mapped and managed in Java. Ensure that memory for such structs is correctly allocated and freed, and that data integrity is maintained.

Example:
```rust
struct ComplexStruct {
    id: i32,
    name: String,
    data: Vec<u8>,
}

#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn new_complex_struct() -> Box<ComplexStruct> {
    Box::new(ComplexStruct {
        id: 1,
        name: String::from("Example"),
        data: vec![1, 2, 3, 4],
    })
}
```

In Java:
```java
try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
    MemorySegment structSegment = arena.allocate(Global.complexStructSize, Global.complexStructAlign);
    MethodHandle newComplexStruct = Global.linker.downcallHandle(
        Global.lib.find("new_complex_struct").orElseThrow(),
        FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.ADDRESS)
    );

    MemorySegment complexStruct = (MemorySegment) newComplexStruct.invokeExact();
    // Use the complexStruct...
}
```
