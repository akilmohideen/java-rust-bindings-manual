# Mapping Rust Features to Java

This section will cover how to properly account for features that are important to Rust. For each Rust concept, the process to Identify a feature and handle it properly in Java will be shown.

By the end of this section, the steps to analyze a Rust function, and determine what needs to be written in Java to bind it correctly, will be clear. This includes handling [lifetimes](lifetimes.md), [ownership](ownership.md), [memory layouts](memory_layout.md), thread safety, and more.
