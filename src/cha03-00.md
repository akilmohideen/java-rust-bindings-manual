# Mapping Rust Features to Java

In this section, we will cover how to map key Rust features to their Java equivalents. For each Rust concept, we'll go through:
1. How to Identify the feature in Rust.
2. What to do in Java to handle it properly.
By the end of this section, you'll be able to look at a Rust function and determine what needs to be written in Java to bind it correctly. This includes handling lifetimes, ownership, memory layouts, thread safety, and more.
