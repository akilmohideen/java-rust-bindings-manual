# Purpose of the Manual

The purpose of this manual is to provide a comprehensive guide for creating Java bindings to Rust libraries using **Java 22** and **Rust 1.81.0**. It will cover the essential steps and concepts required to allow Java applications to call Rust functions, making use of the **Java Foreign Function and Memory API**. By the end of this manual, developers will be able to seamlessly integrate Rustâ€™s high-performance, memory-safe capabilities into their Java applications, enabling cross-language functionality.
