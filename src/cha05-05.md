# UnsatisfiedLinkError When Loading Rust Shared Library

**Cause**: Java cannot find the Rust shared library file (e.g., `.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`) because the file path is incorrect or the library name is misspelled.

**Solution**
1. `Specify Library Path and Name Correctly`: Ensure that the shared library file is available in the system path or specified explicitly.
2. `Check System Compatibility`: Ensure that the library file matches the OS format (e.g., .dll on Windows).

## Example:
```java
// Ensure correct file name for your OS
SymbolLookup lib = SymbolLookup.libraryLookup("libmylibrary.so", Arena.global());
```
## Explanation and Solution:
**Library Path Validation**: Confirm that the library file path is correct, and the file exists. Specifying the full path or ensuring the library is on the system’s path will solve this issue.

## Why It’s Tricky:
If Java cannot locate the Rust library, it throws a runtime error, which can be hard to trace if the path is only slightly incorrect.
