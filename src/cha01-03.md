# How Java and Rust Work Together

How Java and Rust Work Together
Rust is a system-level language that provides fine-grained control over memory management, making it a popular choice for performance-critical applications. Java, on the other hand, excels in providing portability and high-level abstractions. By using the Foreign Function and Memory API in Java 22, developers can leverage Rust’s performance and memory safety in Java applications.
Key components of this integration include:
- **Java’s Foreign Function and Memory API**: This API provides classes such as `SymbolLookup`, `FunctionDescriptor`, `Linker`, `MethodHandle`, `Arena`, and `MemorySegment`, which enable Java to call foreign functions and manage memory effectively.
- **Rust’s Application Binary Interface (ABI)**: Rust functions exposed to Java must adhere to the **C ABI**, ensuring compatibility between the two languages.
- **Memory Management**: The manual will explore how to allocate, manage, and release memory safely between Java and Rust, ensuring optimal performance and avoiding memory leaks or undefined behavior.
