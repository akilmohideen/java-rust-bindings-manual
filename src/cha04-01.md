# Handling Rust Structs in Java

## Rust Side
In Rust, a struct is a user-defined type that groups related values. Structs use specific memory layouts, which must match on the Java side. The layout of structs is especially crucial for cross-language bindings because memory misalignment can lead to undefined behavior.

### Example Rust Struct:
```rust
#[repr(C)]  // Ensures compatibility with C-style memory layout
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
```

Explanation: The `#[repr(C)]` attribute ensures that the struct is laid out in memory according to the C ABI, which is compatible with Java's FFM API.

## Java Side

To use this struct in Java, we need to:
- Define a `StructLayout` that matches the Rust struct layout.
- Use `VarHandles` to access each struct field.

### Example Java Code:

```java
StructLayout pointLayout = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("x"),  // Maps to Rust's i32 `x`
    ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("y")   // Maps to Rust's i32 `y`
);

VarHandle xHandle = pointLayout.varHandle(PathElement.groupElement("x"));
VarHandle yHandle = pointLayout.varHandle(PathElement.groupElement("y"));
```

### Explanation:
- `ValueLayout.JAVA_INT`: This matches Rust’s i32 type.
- `withName("x")` and `withName("y")`: Naming each field lets us retrieve a VarHandle to read and write to specific fields of the MemorySegment that represents the Rust struct.

## Allocating and Using the Struct

**Allocate Memory**: Use an arena to manage the memory allocation.

**Access Fields**: Access x and y using VarHandles.

```java
var arena = Arena.ofConfined();
MemorySegment pointSegment = arena.allocate(pointLayout);

xHandle.set(pointSegment, 0, 10);  // Set x = 10
yHandle.set(pointSegment, 0, 20);  // Set y = 20

int x = (int) xHandle.get(pointSegment);  // Get x value
int y = (int) yHandle.get(pointSegment);  // Get y value
```

### Explanation:

**Arena Allocation**: Using an arena (e.g., `Arena.ofConfined()`) ensures the struct’s memory is safely managed.

**Set and Get Values**: `VarHandle` operations allow us to interact with Rust struct fields directly, facilitating cross-language data manipulation.
