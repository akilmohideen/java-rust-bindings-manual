# Setting Up and Linking Rust and Java

In this section, we will explain how to set up and link the Rust and Java sides to create Java bindings for Rust libraries. This process involves configuring Rust to export functions in a way Java can access, and using Java's **Foreign Function and Memory API** to dynamically link to the Rust code. We'll also cover how to work with **FunctionDescriptors**, **Arenas**, **MemoryLayouts**, and other key components necessary to ensure safe and efficient communication between Java and Rust.
