# Setting Up and Linking Rust and Java

In this section, we will explain how to set up and link both Rust and Java code, in order to create Java bindings for Rust libraries. This process involves exporting Rust functions in a way Java can access, and using Java's [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) to dynamically link to Rust code. We will also cover how to work with [`FunctionDescriptor`](function_descriptor.md), [`Arena`](arenas.md), [`MemoryLayout`](memory_layout.md), and other key components necessary to ensure safe and efficient communication between Java and Rust.
