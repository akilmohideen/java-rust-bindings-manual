## Debugging

When debugging, pay special attention to:

- **Memory management:** Ensure that memory is correctly allocated and freed.
- **Function signatures:** Verify that the Rust function signatures match those expected by Java.
- **Data integrity:** Ensure that data passed between Rust and Java is correctly handled, especially when dealing with complex structures or lifetimes.
- **Synchronization:** In multi-threaded applications, ensure that data races and deadlocks are avoided.
