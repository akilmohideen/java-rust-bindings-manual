# Handling Thread Safety in Rust

## Identifying Thread Safety in Rust
In Rust, **thread safety** is ensured using the [Send and Sync](send_and_sync.md) traits. If a Rust function operates across multiple threads, the types used in the function must implement `Send` or `Sync`. For example, if a Rust function uses a **Mutex** or **Arc** to manage shared data, it is thread-safe.

### Example:
```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

pub fn create_shared_data() -> Arc<Mutex<i32>> {
    Arc::new(Mutex::new(42))
}
```

The function returns a thread-safe `Arc<Mutex<i32>>`, which ensures that multiple threads can safely access and modify the shared data.

## Ensuring Thread Safety in Java
When dealing with thread safety across languages, Java must ensure that memory is safely shared between threads. Java’s [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) provides [**Shared Arenas**](arenas.md), which allow memory to be safely accessed by multiple threads.

### What to Do:
- Use **Shared Arenas** when shared memory or thread-safe operations are expected in Rust.
- Java also provides synchronization mechanisms like **synchronized blocks** to ensure thread safety.

### Java Example (Handling Thread Safety):
```java
// Create a shared arena for multi-threaded operations
var sharedArena = Arena.ofShared();
MemorySegment sharedSegment = sharedArena.allocate(8);  // Allocate space for shared memory

// Call Rust function that operates on shared data
RustBindings.createSharedData.invokeExact(sharedSegment);

// Access shared data across threads (ensure proper synchronization in Java)
synchronized (sharedSegment) {
    // Safe access to shared memory here
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Shared Arena**: Ensures that memory is safely shared across threads in Java when interacting with Rust’s thread-safe types like `Arc` and `Mutex`.
- **Synchronized Block**: Ensures that only one thread accesses the shared memory at a time, mimicking Rust’s ownership rules for shared data.
