# Value Layout
`ValueLayout` is the most primitive layout type, representing the layout of,
well, primitives. They are:
<br>  
1. ValueLayout.ADDRESS
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_BOOLEAN
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_CHAR
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_FLOAT
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_INT
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_SHORT
1. ValueLayout.ADDRESS_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_CHAR_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_FLOAT_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG_UNALIGNED
1. ValueLayout.JAVA_SHORT_UNALIGNED
 
These all correspond to the Java
primitives (`ADDRESS` is a bit special), [aligned and unaligned](size_and_alignment.md), which have
direct mappings to C primitive types.

| **Java Type** | **C Type** | **Rust Type** |
|---------------|------------|---------------|
| ValueLayout.ADDRESS | pointer | pointer or Option\<reference\> 
| ValueLayout.ADDRESS_UNALIGNED | pointer with alignment 1 | ditto with alignment 1 
| ValueLayout.JAVA_BOOLEAN | char but must be 0 or 1 | bool |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE | char | i8 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_CHAR | short storing a UTF-16 codepoint | u16 storing a UTF-16 codepoint |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_CHAR_UNALIGNED | ditto with alignment 1 | ditto with alignment 1 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE | double | f64 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE_UNALIGNED | f64 with alignment 1 | 
| ValueLayout.JAVA_FLOAT | float | f32 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_FLOAT_UNALIGNED | float with alignment 1 | f32 with alignment 1 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_INT | int | i32 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED | int with alignment 1 | i32 with alignment 1 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG | long | i64 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG_UNALIGNED | long with alignment 1 | i64 with alignment 1 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_SHORT | short | i16 |
| ValueLayout.JAVA_SHORT_UNALIGNED | short with alignment 1 | i16 with alignment 1 |

So the `_UNALIGNED` versions are exactly the same as their counterparts
except that they have an alignment of 1. This allows storing them unaligned,
but it will also force the JVM to issue special instruction sequences to load
values, since most CPU architectures do not natively support unaligned loads
and stores from or to memory. It is also worth noting that
`ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE` and `ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG` have
platform-dependent alignment because some CPU architectures require
natural alignment (size = alignment, so 8 in this case) whereas some like
x86 only require an alignment of 4. All other primitives are defined to have
natural alignment.

Beyond representing primitive types, `ValueLayouts` also provide access to
different byte [ordering](orderings.md) (also known as endianness) through the
`.withOrder(ByteOrder)` method. The choices for `ByteOrder` are `BIG_ENDIAN`,
and `LITTLE_ENDIAN`, although the static method `ByteOrder.nativeOrder()`
will return whichever of those your CPU natively uses (usually
`LITTLE_ENDIAN`). This is required by many serialization formats, such as
most network formats, because many of them require `BIG_ENDIAN` byte
order while most CPU architectures only natively support `LITTLE_ENDIAN`.
Rust doesnâ€™t have `int`, `long`, etc., so we must use a different translation to
