# How Rust and Java Communicate
To enable communication between Rust and Java, Rust compiles code into a [shared library](so.md) that Java can load and invoke using [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454)

This process requires separate files for Rust code and Java bindings, each with specific configurations and naming conventions. The file names and formats may vary depending on your operating system and Rust version.

* **Rust File**: Contains the functions to be exposed to Java. This file is typically named `lib.rs` and located in the `src/` directory of a Rust project.
* **Shared Library File**: This is the compiled output of the Rust code. The file name and extension depend on your operating system.
    * Windows: `FileName.dll`
    * Linux: `FileName.so`
    * macOS:  `FileName.dylib`
    
* **Java File**: Contains the Java code that binds to the Rust shared library. You can name it based on your application, e.g., RustBindings.java.
