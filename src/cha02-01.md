# How Rust and Java Communicate

Java and Rust communicate through **dynamic linking**, where Rust compiles into a [shared library](so.md) file (e.g., `.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux, `.dylib` on macOS). Java loads this library and can interact with its functions.
At a high level, the process looks like this:
* **Rust**: Write Rust functions, export them with `#[no_mangle]` and `extern "C"`, and compile them into a shared library.
* **Java**: Use the Java [FFM API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/454) to load the shared library, find the Rust functions, and invoke them.

The next sections will go step by step through both the Rust and Java setups.
